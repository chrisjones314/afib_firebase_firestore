## What is it?

AFib Firebase Firestore is AFib state library which extends your project-specific AFib command with an `affs:generate` subcommand.   That subcommand generates AFib queries which interact with Firebase's Firestore database.

## Getting Started

If you are not familiar with AFib, you should start by reviewing the [YouTube trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWJyNueiwRc) and [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCprhGAAdME) found on [www.afibframework.io](https://www.afibframework.io).

AFib Firebase Firestore itself has a [brief written guide](https://docs.afibframework.io/v0.5/afib_signin/startup/start_here/), and as it states, you are best off starting with one of AFib's standard signin-related project styles, either `app-starter-signin` or `app-starter-signin-firebase`.   

Creating a new AFib project is covered in [AFib's overall written guide.](https://docs.afibframework.io/v0.5/afib/startup/start_here/).
